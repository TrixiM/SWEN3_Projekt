# Implementation Summary: OCR Worker

## Overview
Successfully implemented **Requirement 3**: REST-Server sends messages to RabbitMQ on document upload, processed by a separate "empty" OCR-worker.

## Changes Made

### 1. New OCR Worker Application
Created a completely separate Spring Boot application in `ocr-worker/`:

**Files Created:**
- `ocr-worker/pom.xml` - Maven configuration with RabbitMQ dependencies
- `ocr-worker/DOCKERFILE.OCR` - Docker build configuration
- `ocr-worker/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `ocr-worker/src/main/java/fhtw/wien/ocrworker/`
  - `OcrWorkerApplication.java` - Main Spring Boot application
  - `config/RabbitMQConfig.java` - RabbitMQ configuration
  - `messaging/OcrMessageConsumer.java` - Message consumer that processes document events
  - `dto/DocumentResponse.java` - Data transfer object for messages
  - `domain/DocumentStatus.java` - Document status enum
- `ocr-worker/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Application configuration

### 2. Modified Existing Files

**backend/src/main/java/fhtw/wien/messaging/DocumentMessageConsumer.java**
- Removed document created message handling (moved to OCR worker)
- Kept document deleted message handling (REST server responsibility)
- This ensures clean separation of concerns

**docker-compose.yml**
- Added `ocr-worker` service configuration
- Configured to depend on RabbitMQ
- Connected to app-network for inter-service communication

### 3. Documentation Files

**OCR-WORKER-IMPLEMENTATION.md**
- Detailed explanation of the implementation
- Architecture diagrams
- Testing instructions
- Verification checklist
- Future enhancement suggestions

**test-ocr-worker.sh**
- Automated test script
- Verifies all services are running
- Tests document upload
- Checks OCR worker logs
- Provides helpful output and next steps

## How It Works

```
User uploads document
        â†“
REST Server (port 8080)
        â†“
Saves to PostgreSQL
        â†“
Publishes message to RabbitMQ
        â†“
OCR Worker receives message
        â†“
Processes document (simulated)
        â†“
Sends acknowledgment
```

## Key Features

### âœ… Separate Application
- OCR worker runs independently from REST server
- Own Docker container
- Own configuration
- Own dependencies

### âœ… Message Queue Integration
- RabbitMQ handles message passing
- Durable queues ensure reliability
- JSON serialization for messages
- Acknowledgment system

### âœ… Empty Worker Implementation
- Receives and logs messages
- Simulates processing (1-second delay)
- Sends acknowledgments
- Ready for future OCR implementation

### âœ… Docker Integration
- Fully containerized
- Easy to deploy and scale
- Proper service dependencies
- Network isolation

## Running the System

### Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Test the Implementation
```bash
./test-ocr-worker.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Upload a document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/documents \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  -F "title=Test Document"

# Watch OCR worker logs
docker-compose logs -f ocr-worker
```

### Expected OCR Worker Output
```
ðŸš€ Starting OCR Worker Application...
âœ… OCR Worker Application started successfully
ðŸ“„ OCR WORKER RECEIVED: Document created - ID: xxx, Title: 'Test Document'
ðŸ“‹ Document Details:
   - Filename: test.pdf
   - Content Type: application/pdf
   - Size: 12345 bytes
   - Status: PENDING
ðŸ”„ Simulating OCR processing...
âœ… OCR processing completed successfully for document: xxx
ðŸ“¤ Sent acknowledgment to queue
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Services Running**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   Should show: rest-server, frontend, postgres, pgadmin, rabbitmq, **ocr-worker**

2. **Upload Document**
   Use REST API or frontend to upload a document

3. **Check RabbitMQ**
   - Visit http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
   - Verify `document.created.queue` exists
   - Check message flow

4. **Check OCR Worker Logs**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f ocr-worker
   ```
   Should show document received and processed

## Architecture Benefits

### Microservices Pattern
- Separate services with specific responsibilities
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Isolated failures

### Asynchronous Processing
- Non-blocking document uploads
- Background OCR processing
- Better user experience

### Message Queue Benefits
- Reliable message delivery
- Load distribution
- Processing retries
- Service decoupling

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Basic OCR
- Integrate Tesseract or similar OCR engine
- Process PDF files
- Extract text content
- Store results in database

### Phase 2: Advanced Processing
- Image preprocessing
- Multi-language support
- Confidence scoring
- Table extraction

### Phase 3: Scalability
- Multiple worker instances
- Load balancing
- Distributed processing
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Monitoring
- Metrics collection
- Health checks
- Alert system
- Processing dashboards

## Testing Checklist

- [x] REST server publishes to RabbitMQ on upload
- [x] RabbitMQ exchange and queues configured
- [x] OCR worker connects to RabbitMQ
- [x] OCR worker receives messages
- [x] OCR worker processes messages
- [x] OCR worker sends acknowledgments
- [x] Docker build succeeds
- [x] All services start correctly
- [x] Message flow works end-to-end
- [x] Logs show proper activity

## Conclusion

**Requirement 3 is FULLY IMPLEMENTED and VERIFIED**

The system now has:
- âœ… REST server that publishes messages to RabbitMQ on document upload
- âœ… Properly configured RabbitMQ message queue
- âœ… Separate "empty" OCR worker that processes these messages
- âœ… Complete Docker integration
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation and testing tools

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future OCR functionality while meeting all current requirements.
