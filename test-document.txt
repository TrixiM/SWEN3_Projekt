TEST DOCUMENT FOR GENAI SUMMARIZATION

This is a test document to verify the GenAI integration.

Introduction:
This document contains sample text that will be processed by the OCR worker 
and then summarized by the GenAI worker using Google Gemini API.

Main Content:
The document management system consists of several microservices working together.
When a user uploads a PDF document, it goes through multiple processing steps.

First, the REST API saves the document to MinIO object storage and stores 
metadata in PostgreSQL database. Then it publishes a message to RabbitMQ.

The OCR worker receives the message, downloads the PDF from MinIO, and 
extracts text using Tesseract OCR engine. The extracted text is then 
published to another RabbitMQ queue.

The GenAI worker listens for OCR completion events. When it receives 
extracted text, it calls the Google Gemini API to generate a concise 
summary of the document content.

Finally, the summary is sent back to the REST API which stores it in 
the database, making it searchable and accessible to users.

Conclusion:
This architecture demonstrates event-driven microservices with asynchronous 
processing, message queuing, and AI-powered text summarization.
